### Development_Guide

your club folder will be statically served ( file stucture will be served as it is ) <br>

eg- <br>

- a file `clubs/team_exe/index.html` is available on https://festnimbus.com/clubs/team_exe/
  > index.html is a special file name and it is picked up by default if no file name is mentioned in url.
- a file `clubs/team_exe/about.html` is available on https://festnimbus.com/clubs/team_exe/about.html
  - you can make url look like `/team_exe/about` by structuring file like `../team_exe/about/index.html`
- and so on..

there is a Template provided in `_template/` directory. _Note - it is **NOT** required to strictly follow this template_ - you can follow any design of your choice, add as many pages as you want. <br/>
but if u wish to use template - copy paste the contents of `_template/` in `<your_club>` folder and make the necessary changes.

#### Run Code

- You can directly open ( double click ) individual html files to view them in browser and refreshing after each change. OR use `Live Serer` VS CODE extention to open your `index.html` file.
